            The exciting thing about the open source movement is the diversity
            of possible projects. From small, local projects to large,
            transnational projects, from simple database solutions to complex
            software projects. As long as the mindset is right, there is
            something for everyone â€“ from analogue dinosaurs to average users to
            absolute experts.

            At opensource.construction, we host and support projects in
            different ways.

            Sandbox Projects are experimental projects that are not yet widely
            tested in production. Incubating Projects are already used
            successfully in production by a small number of users. Graduated
            Projects considered stable, widely adopted and production ready,
            attracting hundreds of users and contributors
