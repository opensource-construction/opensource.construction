## Description

The AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) Hackathon was created in 2013 to give those designing, building, and maintaining our built environment the opportunity to collaborate with cutting edge technologies and its developers and designers. It has quickly become a community of innovators that include all elements of the built environment, not just AEC.

In its 4th year in Denmark and with over 49 events globally, itâ€™s an experience of teching out at its finest for improving the industries that affect all that live or work in a house or building. It has quickly become the largest global community pushing open innovation for the built environment professions.

Our world faces fresh new problems that urgently need brilliant minds to solve them and this is the community that is improving how our world is designed, built, and operated.

If you are a built environment and or tech professional, property owner, expert, student, company, conglomerate, country, alien, robot AI, or other working to improve the built environment / give super powers to its workforce, join us! We welcome you to join a community of passionate individuals improving the industries we love.
